Using the Command Line Terminal, user is able to view product inventory and is prompted to choose and item and quantity for purchase.

If the user selects a quantity that is more than the inventory has, the terminal will log that there is "Insufficient Quantity!".

If the database has enough stock quantity for the purchase, the database will update to reflect a lower inventory and will display new stock quantity to the users.
